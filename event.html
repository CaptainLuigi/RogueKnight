        After walking through the forest for a long amount of time, you came
        across a small clearing in between the dark shadows of the giant
        trees.<br />
        On an altar was laying an ancient weapon of imense power, but no mortal
        beeing was strong enough to lift it.<br /><br />
        So far...<br /><br />
        Trying to lift it would come with a price.<br />

      <span>
        You put your hands around the handle and pulled with all your
        strength.<br />
        The weapon wasn't moving, but you didn't care and kept trying as hard as
        you could.<br />
        Blood started running down your arms and just before you couldn't take
        it any longer,<br />
        the weapon moved and got lighter and lighter for you.<br /><br />
        You looked down on your bloody hands.<br />
        You got the legendary weapon.

        You were walking through the forest, minding your own business and
        always ready for an ambush.<br />
        But after a while, something caught your eye.<br />
        You came closer, with your sword in your hand.<br />
        But then you realised, that it was an abandoned purse from a traveller
        or adventurer before you.<br />

      <span>
        You were walking through the forest, adrenaline still rushing through
        your body from the last fight.<br />
        Slowly you were getting calmer, as you heard something behind you.<br />
        It was a mother bear with her two cubs.<br />
        You had to retrieve slowly to avoid a fight, but two of your weapons
        fell out of your backpack and you just had enough time to pick up one of
        them.<br /><br />
        Which weapon will you leave behind?<br />

        After a few hours into the forest you met a wandering trader.<br />
        "Hello fine sir, I can't offer you my goods, I sold them all in the last
        town,<br />
        but what about a little gamble?", the man spoke.<br />
        "Play with half your gold, and if you win the coinflip, you will gain
        double the amount."<br />

        Skillfully the trader snapped a coin in the air.<br />
        You watched the coin with excitement, as it was flying through the
        air.<br />
        The coin landed back in the hands of the trader and...<br /><br />
        You lost!<br /><br />
        You knew you shouldn't be this greedy, but now it's too late.

      <span>
        Exhausted from the journey through the forest you sat down on a lonely
        stump surrounded by giant trees.<br />
        It was peacefull with a few sumbeams managing their way through dense
        canopy.<br />
        You decide to take a little nap and rest for a while.<br /><br />
        Well rested you get on your way again.

        As you were wandering through the forest, you saw a young lady beeing
        harassed by some outlaws.<br />
        Ready for battle, you approach the men, but at the sight of your
        combat-ready stance, they flee.<br />
        "You came at the right moment", the woman said,<br />
        "but I'm not an ordinary human, I'm an elf and can make one of your
        weapons stronger."<br />

        After walking through the forest for a long amount of time, you came
        across a small clearing in between the dark shadows of the giant
        trees.<br />
        On an altar was laying an ancient weapon of imense power, but no mortal
        beeing was strong enough to lift it.<br /><br />
        So far...<br /><br />
        Trying to lift it would come with a price.<br />

        You were walking through the forest, minding your own business and
        always ready for an ambush.<br />
        But after a while, something caught your eye.<br />
        You came closer, with your sword in your hand.<br />
        But then you realised, that it was an abandoned purse from a traveller
        or adventurer before you.<br />

      <span>
        You were walking through the forest, adrenaline still rushing through
        your body from the last fight.<br />
        Slowly you were getting calmer, as you heard something behind you.<br />
        It was a mother bear with her two cubs.<br />
        You had to retrieve slowly to avoid a fight, but two of your weapons
        fell out of your backpack and you just had enough time to pick up one of
        them.<br /><br />
        Which weapon will you leave behind?<br />

        After a few hours into the forest you met a wandering trader.<br />
        "Hello fine sir, I can't offer you my goods, I sold them all in the last
        town,<br />
        but what about a little gamble?", the man spoke.<br />
        "Play with half your gold, and if you win the coinflip, you will gain
        double the amount."<br />

        On an altar was laying an ancient weapon of imense power, but no mortal
        beeing was strong enough to lift it.<br /><br />

        Blood started running down your arms and just before you couldn't take
        it any longer,<br />
        the weapon moved and got lighter and lighter for you.<br /><br />
        You looked down on your bloody hands.<br />

        You wake up moments later, your head pounding. The forest is still and
        silent, but something feels wrong. As you gather your bearings, you
        notice your pouch is lighter, your gold is gone!<br /><br />

        But then, as your fingers brush the folds of your tunic, you feel
        something — your hidden pocket. Reaching inside, you find a remaining
        stash of gold, just enough to keep you going. It seems the thieves
        missed this one small detail.

        A faint whisper calls your name, drawing you toward a figure cloaked in
        silver mist. Its form shifts, never quite solid, never quite real.<br />
        The creature tilts its head, eyes gleaming with ancient wisdom, and
        gestures toward your weapons. Without a word, it reaches out, its
        ethereal fingers hovering over them, waiting.<br />

        open sky.<br />
        Lightning flashes — brief, blinding. In that instant, you see it:<br />
        a lone tree, its branches trembling in the wind. The storm roars
        overhead, the next strike drawing closer.<br />
        You have a choice.<br />
        Stay in the open, defenseless against the storm, or run to the tree —

        weapons are gone — vanished without a trace.<br />

        You reach for it, but it's far too heavy to lift.<br />
        A thought crosses your mind. You could break the statue, shattering gold

        The weight of it settles in your chest. This gold will come at a cost.

        A warning prickles at the edge of your mind — this beauty is not what

        Then — pain. <br />A sharp, searing pull, like your very essence is
        being drained. You gasp, blinking through the haze, and see her now for

        Her beauty twists, eyes darkening, fangs glinting in the dim light.<br />A
        succubus. <br />She grins, no longer inviting but predatory. Clawed

        with sympathy. "I can heal you completely, return your strength to its

        The fairy's wings flutter as she hovers closer, her tiny hands glowing
        with magical energy. "In exchange for healing, your maximum health will
        be slightly reduced.<br />
        A small price for a second chance, don't you think?"

        pain grips your chest.<br />
        A voice whispers in your mind: "Blood for power, life for might."<br />
        The relic pulses, offering immense strength at the cost of your own
